# 🧠 JavaScript Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated set of JavaScript projects built during my journey through freeCodeCamp and self-practice. These projects demonstrate my hands-on experience with:

- DOM manipulation
- Local storage
- Object-oriented and functional programming
- Fetch API and asynchronous JavaScript
- Algorithmic thinking and UI interactivity

Each project is placed in a separate folder, includes readable code, and is accompanied by a visual screenshot.
